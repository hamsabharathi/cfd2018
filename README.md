When natural disasters strike, resource (like food, medicine and clothes) availabilty is a crucial public health concern and has a great deal of nonlinearity and irregularity, it has poor prediction performance of applying the traditional statistical and econometric models. 
Under the extraordinary conditions that may occur during and after such disasters, the following issues require immediate attention:
• Provision for safe food and water
• Availability of medical kits and anti-diarrhoeal agents, anti-emetics or other medication for gastrointestinal problems, etc.
• Distribution of clothes
• Replenishing the fuel supply

We propose a solution to forecast the demand of these resources in flood affected regions. Certain predictions will help the state government or the central government in taking the required relief measures.
We shall collect the demographic data of the flood affected regions in the past and study them. The census data comprises of attributes like age, sex, population density, etc. will be very helpful in determining the disaster relief methods.

The users would benefit substantially from this. An accurate prediction of the quantity of commodities needed, before or during the disaster, would really improve the situation as these commodities can be delivered timely which hopefully would also suffice the victims. Our primary user, the state and central governments, will get a clear idea about the requirements after the situation and they can take preventive measures and allocate a certain amount of funds for the same, since it becomes difficult to communicate after the calamity has occured.

An amalgamation of useful attributes from several datasets would be used for this solution. Few of them are: 
1. State-wise census of India 2017 from https://data.gov.in
2. State-wise commodity consumption trends of dairy production companies
3. State-wise power consumption trends of electricity boards

The technology stack includes machine learning packages available in Python and statistical tools like R.
